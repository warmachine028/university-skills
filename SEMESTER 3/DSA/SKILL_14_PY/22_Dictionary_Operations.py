""" CODE 22:
Repeatedly ask the user to enter a team name and the how many games the team won and how many they lost. Store this
information in a dictionary where the keys are the team names and the values are lists of the form [wins, losses].
(a) Using the dictionary created above, allow the user to enter a team name and print out the teamâ€™s winning percentage.
(b) Using the dictionary, create a list whose entries are the number of wins of each team.
(c) Using the dictionary, create a list of all those teams that have winning records
