# ASSIGNMENT NO.-12(Searching/Sorting)

1. Implement binary search using C-programming language. [Solution](1_Binary_Search.c)

2. There is a sorted set of numbers given 33,44,55,57,62,64,67,71,73,74,76,78,79,89,99. [Solution](2_Impl_Bin_Search.c)
   Write down a binary search program in C- programming language to find out the position of “78”.

3. Given a set of numbers. Find an element in the array using linear search. [Solution](3_Linear_search.py)
   Implement using python language.(gedit filename.py)

4. Given the unsorted list [6, 5, 4, 3, 7, 1, 2], show what the contents of the list would be after each iteration of the loop as it is sorted using the following: a) Selection sort b) Insertion sort(using C) [Solution](4_Selection_sort.c)

5. Implement Bubble sort using Python language. [Solution](5_Bubble_sort.py)

6. Implement heap sort using Python language. [Solution](6_Heap_sort.py)

7. Implement Insertion sort using Python language. [Solution](7_Insertion_sort.py)

8. Take input of the following elements – 10,20,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,66,77,88,89. [Solution](8_Interpolation_Search.py)
   Find 66 using proper sorting approach in python.

9. Write a C program to implement quick sort. [Solution](9_Quick_Sort.c)

10. Implement Selection sort using Python language. [Solution](10_Selection_sort.py)

11. Implement Merge sort using Python language. [Solution](11_Merge_sort.py)

12. Given the unsorted list [61, 25,14, 3,17,21, 29], show what the contents of the list would be after each iteration of the loop as it is sorted using the following: [Solution](12_Bubble_Insertion.c)
    a) Bubble sort
    b) Insertion sort (Use C)

13. Create a structure/class for a group of 50 students holding data for their Regn no., Name, Branch, CGPA. [Solution](13_Class.py)
    a) Call linear search function to display data of student with a particularRegn no..
    b) Call bubble sort function to arrange data of students according to Regn no.
    c) Apply binary search on the above output (part b) to display data of a student with a particular Regn no.
    d) Use and modify Insertion sort logic to arrange data of students in descending order of CGPA.
