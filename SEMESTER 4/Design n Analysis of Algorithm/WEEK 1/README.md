## Brushing the Basics - 18th February 2022

1. [Bubble Sort](1_Bubble_sort.c)  
    You have been given an array A of size N . you need to sort this array non-decreasing oder using bubble sort. However, you do not need to print the sorted array . You just need to print the number of swaps required to sort this array using bubble sort

2. [Linear Search](2_Linear_search.c)  
    You have been given an array of size N consisting of integers. In addition you have been given an element M you need to find and print the index of the last occurrence of this element M in the array if it exists in it, otherwise print -1. Consider this array to be 1 indexed.

3. [Binary Search](3_Binary_search.c)  
    You have been given an array A consisting of N integers. All the elements in this array A are unique. You have to answer some queries based on the elements of this array. Each query will consist of a single integer x. You need to print the rank based position of this element in this array considering that the array is 1 indexed. The rank based position of an element in an array is its position in the array when the array has been sorted in ascending order.

4. [Insertion Sort](4_Insertion_sort.c)  
    You have been given an A array consisting of N integers. All the elements in this array are guaranteed to be unique. For each position i in the array A you need to find the position A[i] should be present in, if the array was a sorted array. You need to find this for each i and print the resulting solution.

5. [Selection Sort](5_Selection_sort.c)  
    Consider an Array a of size N Iterate from 1 to N In ith iteration select the i th minimum and swap it with a[i]
    You are given an array a, size of the array N and an integer x. Follow the above algorithm and print the state of the array after x iterations have been performed.
