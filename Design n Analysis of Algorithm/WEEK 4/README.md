## Search Algorithms - 11th March 2022

1. [Breadth First Search](1_Breadth_first_search.c)  
   Given an adjacency matrix representation of a graph, compute the shortest path from a source vertex to a goal vertex using Breadth First Search. In case of a tie, a smaller indexed vertex should be preferable to a larger indexed vertex.

2. [Depth First Search](2_Depth_first_search.c)  
   You have been given a graph consisting of N nodes and M edges. The nodes in this graph are enumerated from 1 to N . The graph can consist of self-loops as well as multiple edges. This graph consists of a special node called the head node. You need to consider this and the entry point of this graph. You need to find and print the number of nodes that are unreachable from this head node.
