1. For University Sports Day for the participants' score sheet, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up. You can use in build functions to solve the problem.
The first line contains . The second line contains an array of integers each separated by a space.
Constraints:
-> 2<=n<=10
-> -100<=A[i]<=100
Final output: Print the runner-up score.
ex: Given list is [2,4,6,6,5] . The maximum score is , second maximum is . Hence, we print as the runner-up score.

4. Write a program to implement a sort technique that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted.

5. Write a program to implement a sort technique that works on the principle of divide and 
conquer strategy.

6. Write a program to define a union and a structure both having exactly the same members. 
Using the size of operator, print the size of structure variable as well as union variable 
and comment on the result.2
7. Declare a structure time that has three fields—hr,min, sec. Create two variables 
start_time and end_time. Input their values from the user. Then while start_time does not 
reach the end_time,display GOOD DAY on the screen.
8. Declare a structure fraction that has two fields—numerator and denominator. Create two 
variables and compare them using function. Return 0 if the two fractions are equal, –1 if 
the first fraction is less than the second and 1 otherwise. You may convert a fraction into 
a floating point number for your convenience.
9. Write a program to calculate the area of one of the geometric figures—circle, rectangle or 
a triangle. Write a function to calculate the area.The function must receive one parameter 
which is a structure that contains the type of figure and the size of the components 
needed to calculate the area must be a part of a union. Note that a circle requires just one 
component, rectangle require stwo components and a triangle requires the sizeof three 
components to calculate the area.
