2.Using the concept of passing Structures as function arguments and returning a 
structure from a function in C language, add two numbers.

8.C program to show insertion sort for an unsorted list [60, 50, 90, 30, 70, 10]

11. Given a undirected Graph of N vertices: 1 to N, and M edges, consider the 
representation of the input graph such that that there is an edge between vertex X and 
vertex Y, the task is to write a C program to create Adjacency Matrix of the given 
Graph
			0 -- 1                             V
                        |    | > 4		           |
                        2 -- 3                             E
13. C program to show the dfs traversal of the graph
Input is: 5 vertices (starting vertex is marked as 0)
Take graph data in matrix form as follows:
0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0
