Create a general class ThreeDObject and derive the classes Box, Cube, Cylinder and Cone from it.
The class ThreeDObject has methods wholeSurfaceArea() and volume(), 
Override these 2 methods in each of the derived classes to calculate the volume and whole surface area of each of three-dimentional objects.
The dimentions of the objects are to be taken from the users and passed through the respective constructors of each derived classes.
Write a main method to test these classes.
