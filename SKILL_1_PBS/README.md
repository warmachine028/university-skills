2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. [Solution](2_C_to_F.py)
   [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
   INPUT:
   60Â°C
   OUTPUT:
   140 in Fahrenheit

3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. [Solution](3_Guess.py)
   INPUT:
   Guess a number between 1 and 10 until you get it right : 5  
   OUTPUT:
   Well guessed!

   Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

      Type of (1+2j) is <class 'complex'>
      Type of True is <class 'bool'>
      Type of w3resource is <class 'str'>
      Type of (0, -1) is <class 'tuple'>
      Type of [5, 12] is <class 'list'>
      Type of {'class': 'V', 'section': 'A'} is < class 'dict'>
   ```

7. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6. [Solution](7_Print_except_3_6.py)
   Note : Use 'continue' statement.
   Input: 6
   Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

8. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
   Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers : [Solution](8_50_Fibo.py)
   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
   Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
   INPUT: 50
   Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

9. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". [Solution](9_BuzzFizz.py)
   Input:
   Enter no:51
   Sample Output :
   fizzbuzz
   1
   2
   fizz
   4
   buzz
   .
