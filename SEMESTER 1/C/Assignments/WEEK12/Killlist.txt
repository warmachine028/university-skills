1.  Write the function definition of the following function declaration in C programming
    language.Use it to swap two numbers.Here, ‘a’ and ‘b’ are formal arguments to accept
    the addresses of numbers passed to it.
    
    void swap(int *a, int *b);

2.  Write the function definition of the following function declaration in C programming
    language.Use this function to calculate the value of 𝑥^𝑛 where 𝑥 and 𝑛 is user given.
    
    double pow(double x, int n);

3.  Write the function definition of the following recursive function declaration in C
    programming language.Use this function to calculate GCD of two user given number(a, b).
    
    int GCD(int a, int b);

4.  Write the function definition of the following recursive function declaration in C
    programming language.Use this function to calculate the factorial of a user given
    number ‘n’.
    
    int fact(int n);

5.  Write the function definition of the following function declaration in C programming
    language.Use this function to calculate the Binomial Coefficients(
          𝑛          𝑛!
        ---- =   ---------   For any user given value of 𝑛 and 𝑟  .
          𝑟       𝑟!(𝑛−𝑟)!
    Use the previously defined function “fact()” (Question no.4) in this program.
    
    int ncr(int n, int r);

6.  Write the function definition of the following function declaration in C programming
    language. Use this function to calculate the length of a user given String.Here, ‘s’ is
    formal arguments to accept the address of the string passed to it.
    
    int strlen(char *s);

7. Write the function definition of the following function declaration in C programming
    language.Use this function to reverse a user given string.Use the function declared &
    defined in Question no.5. Here, ‘s’ is formal arguments to accept the address of the
    string passed to it.
    
    char* strrev(char *s);

8. Write a C program to check if a user given String is palindrome or not .Use the function
    declared & defined in Question no.5.
