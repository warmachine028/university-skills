1. Write a C program to read ‘n’ numbers from user into an array where ‘n’ is user given. Print the difference of the sum of positive and sum of negative numbers.

2. Write the function definition of the following recursive function declaration in C programming language. Use this function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where ‘n’ is user given.

                        int fib(int n);

3. A matrix (a) is said to be Upper Triangular if it satisfies the following conditions:
     𝑎[𝑖][𝑗] = { 𝑥, 𝑖 ≤ 𝑗, 𝑥 ≠ 0
                0, 𝑖 > 𝑗
Write a C program to check if a user given matrix of size 3×3 is upper triangular or not.

4. A string is called a palindrome when spelled forward is same if spelled backward. Write a C program to read a user given string of any size of your choice. Check if the string is Palindrome or not. Do not use ‘string.h’.
