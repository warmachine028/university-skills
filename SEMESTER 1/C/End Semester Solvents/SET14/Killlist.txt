1. Write a C program to find the nth term of the following sequence of numbers where ‘n’ is user given: 1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9….

2. Write a C program to take a 2x3 matrix input from user. Now, take another number input from user and replace all elements which are below this number in the matrix by ‘0’.

3. Write a C program to take a string input from user and count the number of digits. Assume that the maximum length of string is 10.

4. A strict integer array is a fixed size array. If user attempts to store more elements than the array can actually accommodate then the array will start storing the new elements from the beginning. Suppose an array has size 10, then if user attempts to store 11th element, it will be stored in 1st position and so on. Write a C program to create a strict array of size 10. Read user given numbers to store in the array. User will decide the total number of inputs.
